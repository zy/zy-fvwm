# This Fvwm2 setup file provides the basic emacs-centered environment
# that I have found most comfortable on my standalone machine at home.
# Basically it gives me a big Emacs window at the left and a slightly
# smaller XTerm at the right, together with a clock and CPU monitor
# and a few buttons for accessing independent desktops.

# I've tried to write lots of comments because I will certainly forget
# most of the details of Fvwm2's syntax and semantics before long.

# My screen is 1024 pixels wide and 768 high; about 88dpi.

# First, make sure that Exec chooses tcsh instead of bash:
ExecUseShell /bin/tcsh

# Next, specify the paths for all icons (.xpm files) that I'm using:
# PixmapPath /usr/share/icons:/home/icons
ImagePath /home/icons:/usr/share/icons

# X's font rendering without anti-aliasing looks least bad with the following:

# With FocusFollowsMouse and AutoRaise, I don't need to click for attention.
# (FvwmAuto will raise the window after one second = 1000 milliseconds.)
# But I set SloppyFocus on text windows below; this keeps them focused
# when the mouse goes over an empty ("root window") area.

# Now for mouse commands in the root window R:
